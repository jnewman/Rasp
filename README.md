This is just a collection of utilities at the moment. The plan is to create a 
library that'll lay on top of Dojo and help me do useful stuff, like:

 - Initialize widgets just in time
 - Extend Array to provide nicer collections
 - Whatever seems useful
 
*Dependencies*

 - tinymce >= 3.5
 - dojo >= 1.7
 - CodeMirror >= 2.2
